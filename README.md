# Abstract

This project analyzes the success of various digital advertising campaigns to pinpoint the most effective strategies. By focusing on key metrics such as revenue, cost, and ROI, we uncover which campaigns provide the best returns. The insights drawn from this analysis offer practical guidance on optimizing ad budgets and enhancing overall performance. The goal is to equip the digital marketing team with data-driven insights for better decision-making and increased marketing efficiency.

# Introduction

Understanding campaign efficacy is essential in today's digital marketing environment for strategic budget allocation and ROI maximization. The difficulty facing the digital marketing division is figuring out which of their advertising initiatives provide the best results. It can be challenging to determine which advertisements generate the most income and interaction when several campaigns are running across several channels and formats. Missed opportunities or excessive spending on unsuccessful advertising might result from poor budgeting. Through the analysis of a dataset of digital advertising efforts, this research seeks to address these issues. To determine which campaigns generate the most and least revenue, find out whether advertising expenses and income are correlated and find the campaigns with the best return on investment are the main goals of this analysis.

Sources of Data 
Detailed data on various digital advertising initiatives, including indicators that monitor performance over several months, are included in the dataset utilized in this analysis. Important data columns consist of: 
• Date Specifics: The day and month of every advertising campaign. 
• Campaign ID: A special number assigned to every campaign. 
• User Engagement: E.g High, Low.
• Banner Dimensions: Indicates the size of the banner. 
• Placement: Where the advertisement is displayed. 
Total ad impressions are displayed. 
• Cost: The amount spent on each advertisement. 
• Clicks: Total number of clicks on ads. 
• Revenue: The money made from each advertisement. 
The quantity of conversions that occur after ad clicks is known as post-click conversions. 
The sales amount after clicks is known as the "post-click sales amount

# Tools

The techniques used are:
1. Data Cleaning: o Handled missing values and eliminated unnecessary columns. To evaluate ROI, a new profit column was calculated. 
2. EDA or Exploratory data analysis: Metrics like mean, median, lowest, and maximum for important variables (such as revenue, cost, and clicks) are computed in descriptive statistics. Also, for the campaign performance summary and to investigate the connection between cost and revenue, line charts were made (correlation analysis) 
3. Data Visualization: Bar Charts, line charts and dashboard.

# Discussion
The analysis reveals that not all high-cost campaigns yield high revenue, emphasizing the importance of calculating ROI alongside revenue to measure effectiveness. Campaign 1 achieved the highest ROI despite not being the highest in cost, indicating a cost-effective approach. Campaign 3 with low ROI suggests strategic adjustments, such as budget reduction or refining targeting and engagement. The correlation between cost and revenue suggests that campaigns with higher costs generally yield more revenue, but this is not the case across all campaigns.

# Conclusion 
this analysis of digital advertising campaigns highlights the critical importance of evaluating key performance metrics like revenue, cost, and ROI to optimize advertising strategies. The findings demonstrate that not all high-cost campaigns result in high revenue, underscoring the need for careful ROI assessment to gauge campaign effectiveness. While some campaigns show a strong correlation between spending and returns, others suggest that factors such as targeting and creative content play a crucial role in performance.
The study recommends strategic adjustments based on data-driven insights, such as reallocating budgets to higher-performing campaigns, conducting A/B testing for underperforming ones, and continuously monitoring campaign performance via dashboards. By leveraging these insights, digital marketing teams can make informed decisions to enhance campaign outcomes, improve cost-efficiency, and maximize overall marketing impact. Ultimately, this research emphasizes the value of a dynamic and data-centric approach to digital advertising, ensuring that marketing resources are used effectively to achieve optimal returns.
