# Introduction

Understanding campaign efficacy is essential in today's digital marketing environment for strategic budget allocation and ROI maximization. The difficulty facing the digital marketing division is figuring out which of their advertising initiatives provide the best results. It can be challenging to determine which advertisements generate the most income and interaction when several campaigns are running across several channels and formats. Missed opportunities or excessive spending on unsuccessful advertising might result from poor budgeting. Through the analysis of a dataset of digital advertising efforts, this research seeks to address these issues. To determine which campaigns generate the most and least revenue, find out whether advertising expenses and income are correlated and find the campaigns with the best return on investment are the main goals of this analysis.
